Forecasting dominance of SARS-CoV-2 lineages by anomaly detection using deep AutoEncoders Simone Rancati, Giovanna Nicora, Mattia Prosperi, Riccardo Bellazzi, Simone Marini, Marco Salemi bioRxiv 2023.10.24.563721; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.24.563721 [# To change with new paper on biorxiv]

Scripts to predict anomalies, i.e., Future Dominant Lineages (FDLs) with the Deep Learning AutoEncoder and to perform the simulation are located in the model folder. Scripts to generate the dataset and the feature representations are within the Feature_Extraction folder.
